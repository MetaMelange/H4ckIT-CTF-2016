#StrangeSongs - Turkey

We got a wav File with different Songs inside.
It was a mixtrack with some quite good songs.

After inspecting the wav file with audacity and hexeditor we found nothing.

So we just looked up the songs and tried the first letters of the songlist.

```S even Nation Army        - The White Stripes <br />
P aint It, Black          - The Rolling Stones <br />
A ll Along The Watchtower - Jimi Hendrix <br />
